I am an iOS developer. I love writing iOS apps. I have thoughts on iOS and the development of the apps that run on the beautiful operating system that it is. So, I thought I should write a blog, mostly for fun, but also maybe to learn something. Below is a recount of the arduous journey that I embarked on to add a blog to my personal site. Tears were shed, but in the end, success was had. Enjoy!

>Done class, time to get this blog up and running.

>Continue to debug, try things, move files, rename files, add files... (I'm not a web developer, none of this makes sense to me)

>Oh. My. Lanta.

>By some miracle, bestowed upon me by the beard of Zeus and hammer of Thor, the site works.
