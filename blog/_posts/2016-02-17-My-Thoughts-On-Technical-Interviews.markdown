>I am about to graduate from my software engineering program and have applied to countless jobs and had a number of technical interviews. Through my experiences and supported by articles I've read (some of which will be linked at the end of this post), I've come to realize that the process is flawed.  


For a software engineer, nothing is more stressful than the dreaded *technical interview*. Starting with the 45 minute phone call where an interviewer poses made up questions that push the interviewee's heart rate into dangerous territory. Then, if you manage to not completely botch that part, you then get invited to interview at the company's office where you'll be grilled for 6-8 hours on questions that StackOverflow could answer for you! But #realTalk, you spend an entire day writing code on a white board in front of interviewers with no resources whatsoever, only the stuff you managed to memorize while spending hours upon hours studying for this interview.

One of the articles linked below put it in a way that makes it seem completely insane:

>Years from now, weâ€™ll look back at the 2015 developer interview as an anachronism, akin to hiring an orchestra cellist with a personality test and a quiz about music theory rather than a blind audition.


And if you think about it, its true. how many employed engineers
- Work alone?
- Work without access to documentation?
- Work without access to the internet?

*Spoiler Alert:* **NONE**

But that is exactly what the current interview process is doing, companies are hiring engineers based on their ability to regurgitate information that could be found in a few Google searches and some time spent on StackOverflow. Take away the engineer's access to those things and yes they may seem to be incompetent, but that is not their fault, it's the process' fault.

There are plenty of people who can talk their way through a technical interview, does that mean they are great programmers? **Maybe** The irony is, the majority of people who *can* code, can't do it well in an interview.




#### So whats the solution??

In my opinion, companies should give the interviewee a project and evaluate them based on their implementation of said project. The project should be something relevant to the company's interests, or even a bug in the live product. Outline the requirements of the project and give the candidate a deadline and let them complete it in their own style that allows them to be creative. Also, PAY THEM FOR THEIR TIME! Even if the solution is total crap, give them a small token to show that you appreciate their time. Upon completion, have the interviewee come into the office and present their solution, where you can pose questions and review the solution.

This will be beneficial to both the company and the candidate, the candidate has an opportunity to showcase their talents without the stressful technical interview setting and they get to do it in a way that actually reflects real life situations (especially if given a bug that needs fixing). The company also benefits, they get to see how a candidate performs when faced with real-world problems, they get a glimpse of the candidate's communication skills during the presentation and they may even come away with a solution to the bug they were trying to fix.

Its a Win-Win.


Now, I realize that hiring a software engineer is not a easy thing to do, false-positives (when you hire someone that doesn't end up meeting your standards) are a huge deal. But giving people a fighting chance by improving the interview process will reduce the risk of false-negatives (when you don't hire someone you should have) which, IMO, are much more tragic. Reading these stories [http://rejected.us](http://rejected.us) makes that clear. My favorite of which is Max Howell: [https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768](https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768)
