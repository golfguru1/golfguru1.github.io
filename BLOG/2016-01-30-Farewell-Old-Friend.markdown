# Farewell Old Friend

January 28 2017 marks the end of Parse as we know it. The foundation of many of my projects, Parse was, *(technically still is)*, one of the best options for a backend to mobile apps.

After building many side projects with it, I have come to know and love Parse. The ease of use and small learning curve made it the obvious choice for the simple minded beginner I once was. The more I used it, the more awesomeness I discovered, Cloud Code and Background Jobs to name a few. Needless to say I was heartbroken when I saw the news.

 I still have a tough time trying to figure out why Facebook decided to kill Parse. There are articles out there that suggest that since it was so powerful and the free-tier was so generous, that people were able to make apps that compete with Facebook's own products.

 >Facebook is savvy to see this and shut down Parse — which after all, only enables companies to build products that compete with Facebook and its apps — while retrofitting Messenger into a communication tool for enterprise.

 I struggle to believe thats the case.

 >Still, the shutdown—even with a year to migrate—casts a shadow over Facebook's improving relationship with developers, at a time when it needs to woo them to build not just social and mobile apps...

I guess I know what I'll be doing for the next year. Getting to know this website quite well: <https://parse.com/docs/server/guide#migrating>
