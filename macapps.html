                <blockquote>
                    Bartender 2 lets you organize your menu bar apps, by hiding them, rearranging them, or moving them to the Bartender Bar. You can display the full menu bar, set options to have menu bar items show in the menu bar when they have updated, or have them always
                    visible in the Bartender Bar. There are many ways to configure Bartender as you wish. Give it a go and find out.

                    Bartender does exaclty what it sounds like, it tends to your bar...menu bar that is (see what I they did there). It organizes the mess that your menu bar will inevitably become and puts everything into a convenient little icon and collapsible drawer.

                    Helium is a fantastic little app that lets you have an <i>always on top</i> browser window. Great for coding and watching Netflix ðŸ˜‰

                    By far the best password manager available. Not only does it look amazing, but the features are unreal.</br>

                <h4><a href="https://evernote.com" target="blank">Evernote</a></h4>
                <p>
                    Apple has recently introduced a big update to their notes apps where they allow notes to have images and other stuff that made it much more usable. However, as someone who uses more that just Apple products, Evernote provides an all-in-one solution for
                    todo lists, saving recipes, saving cool stuff I find on the internet (the list goes on).

                <h4><a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com" target="blank">Spectacle</a></h4>
                <p>
                    Spectacle provides the only windows feature I want on macOS, the snap feature. There are alternatives what allow both keyborad shortcuts and mouse drag, but spectacle is strictly keyboard shortcuts which is fine for me.

                <h4><a href="https://www.gitkraken.com" target="blank">GitKraken</a></h4>
                <p>
                    I was always one for the command line git stuff, but I recently started using GitKraken and I'm never going back. There are many git GUI options but as a developer I always look for apps that have a <b>dark</b> theme and GitKraken fills that requirement quite well. It also has a dope logo IMO.
